Conway's Game of Life

John Conway , one the best mathematicians alive , invented this game by hand before computers to show how complex forms evolve from initial conditions and simple rules . What he invented is known as a cellular automaton . Sadly he is not very famous among the general public . The Game of Life , day algorithm , and look and say numbers are few of his works that ordinary people can appreciate and understand .
